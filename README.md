"# Arran-ECIA" 
#Abstract 
This study assessed two hillsides neighbouring Lochranza on the Isle of Arran to determine whether either is suitable for a carbon offset project such as woodland creation (afforestation) or peatland restoration. Carbon restoration schemes can only go ahead if an Ecological impact assessment is carried out to ensure no significant damage will come to the surrounding environment. The two selected sites in Arran were highly divergent in their features, with the North site an open, less diverse habitat consisting mostly of acid grassland and heath, and the South site possessing areas of bog, wet flushes, and woodland edges. To understand how each site may respond to changes in land use or afforestation, a Phase 1 habitat survey and a baseline analysis of all taxa were completed. From this data, it was observed that the South site contains sensitive peatland and is located within an SSSI, while the North site has priority habitats in its upland section. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the North site may be able to support a small, well-placed tree-planting area in place of its existing bracken, and that the South site may be better suited to peat bog restoration as a carbon-offsetting strategy.
